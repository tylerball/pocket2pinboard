pocket2pinboard 0.0.1
=====================
Release date: October 26, 2012

Introduction
============
pocket2pinboard (p2pb.rb) takes an HTML file exported from Pocket (formerly Read it Later)
and generates a bookmark HTML file compatible with Pinboard.  There is no error checking,
sanity checking, or anything else - I put this together in 10 minutes to move my bookmarks.
So use at your own risk.

System Requirements
===================
Developed with ruby 1.9.3p286
Requires rubygems, bundler, nokogiri, and ERB.

Installation
============

    git clone git://github.com/iyshannon/pocket2pinboard.git
    cd pocket2pinboard
    bundle install
    cp config.yml.example config.yml

Add your [Pinboard API token](https://pinboard.in/settings/password) to `config.yml`.

Usage
=====
Download your Pocket bookmarks from `http://getpocket.com/export/` and put the HTML
file in the `pocket2pinboard` folder.

    ruby p2pb.rb input.html > output.html

Replace `input.html` with the name of your bookmark file.

Adding tags
-----------

You can configure a set of tags to be added to all uploaded bookmarks by adding strings to the `defaulttags` key in `config.yml`, like:

    defaulttags: ['imported', 'frompocket']
